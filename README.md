- Mathematical modeling and simulation
- Scientific computing and optimization
- Traffic flow dynamics and differential equations
- Real-time computer graphics and systems programming

## 🛠️ Featured Projects
- 🚦 **[Traffic Simulator](https://github.com/MankowskiNick/traffic-simulator)**  
  Modeled single- and multi-lane traffic flow using delay differential equations. Submitted paper to *Transportation Research Part B* ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01988)).

- ⛏️ **[Malloc-Craft](https://github.com/MankowskiNick/malloc-craft)**  
  A Minecraft-style voxel engine in C with OpenGL, optimized chunk rendering, and real-time editing.

- 📺 **[3D-SCII](https://github.com/MankowskiNick/3d-scii)**  
  A terminal-based 3D renderer in C using ASCII and ANSI escape codes — no external libraries.

- 🥣 **[Cerialize](https://github.com/MankowskiNick/cerialize)**  
  Cerialize is a lightweight, single-header JSON deserializer written in C.

- 🪵 **[Log Dawg](https://github.com/MankowskiNick/log-dawg)**
